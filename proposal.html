    <h1>Brac is Wack.com</h1>

    <h3>Page Topics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the Brac</li>
        <li>What is the current problem</li>
        <li>The affects on Student life</li>
        <li>Breaking down the costs/benefit analysis of renting out the gym</li>
        <li>Potential Solutions</li>
        <li>A page to collect signatures supporting the cause</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What is this website about?</h3>
    <p>This website is about the Brac and how students have been unable to use it as intended</p>

    <h3>What is the objective of this website?</h3>
    <p>
        The goal of this website is to educate students and faculty about the current issues around the brac. With the main issue being key parts of the gym being rented to outside groups during peak student times. This displaces students and prevents them from mental health recovery activities. 
        Ideally, the website would generate enough digital student signatures to force the administration to stop renting out the courts during peek times. 
    </p>
    <h3>Who is your target audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience will be Babson students who are supportive of changing the bracs rental procedures. </p>
    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <p>On the first page I plan to give a history of the brac and explain the different parts of the brac available for students.
        <br>
        On the second page I will describe the current problem with the school renting out the key areas of the brac at peak times. 
        <br>
        On the third page I will get quotes from students describing how this issue effects them. this page will also look at longer term affects off students inability to exercise.  
        <br>
        The forth page will look at the economics of what the school generates from selling out the gym to outsiders at peak times vs. the costs the students have to pay for gym privledges for a semester. 
        <br>
        The last main page will offer the administration a collection of possible solution that would be better for both sides than the current situation. 
        <br>
        An additional page will have just a student signature option for people to sign to show support for the cause.
